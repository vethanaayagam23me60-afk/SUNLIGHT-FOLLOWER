            "The silence of Willow Creek was typically broken only by the chirping of crickets, the rustle of leaves, or the distant lowing of Bessie the cow. So, when a sound like a hundred anvils falling onto a trampoline echoed through the valley just before dawn, Sheriff Brody nearly dropped his morning coffee.\n",
            "\n",
            "He found it in Mrs. Gable’s prize-winning rose garden. Not *in* the garden, exactly. *Sprawled* across it, crushing half a dozen hybrid tea roses under its colossal, moss-green flank. It was a dragon. A very, very large, very, very confused dragon.\n",
            "\n",
            "Its scales shimmered like polished jade, and its long neck was elegantly curved, ending in a head the size of a minivan, with eyes like ancient amber. A plume of smoky breath curled from its nostrils, smelling faintly of ozone and burnt sugar. It whimpered, a sound remarkably like a deflating hot air balloon, and blinked slowly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mrs. Gable, bless her feisty heart, was already out there, shaking a tiny fist at the beast. \"You get out of my petunias, you overgrown lizard! Do you know how long it takes to grow a Blue Moon Hybrid?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The dragon flinched, its head swivelling towards the furious old woman. It looked less menacing than it did profoundly apologetic. It tried to sit up, accidentally singeing a nearby birdbath with a stray puff of smoke.\n",
            "\n",
            "Word spread through Willow Creek faster than a wildfire. Mayor Thompson, usually flustered by a lost cat, was found stammering into a non-existent walkie-talkie. The local kids, however, were enthralled. Little Timmy, brave as a badger, was the first to approach, offering the dragon a half-eaten peanut butter sandwich.\n",
            "\n",
            "The dragon sniffed it delicately, then gave a low rumble. It didn't eat the sandwich, but it nudged Timmy gently with its snout, a gesture so tender it nearly knocked the boy over.\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the next few days, the dragon, which the town unofficially named \"Smokey\" (much to Mrs. Gable's chagrin, who preferred \"The Horticultural Hazard\"), became a bizarre fixture. It wasn't menacing, just lost. It would gaze at the sky with a mournful sigh, occasionally blowing a ring of smoke that smelled of distant pine forests and magic. It seemed to like the bakery's peach pies, delivered cautiously by old Mr. Henderson, and the shade of the old oak tree in the town square.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sheriff Brody called every agency imaginable. \"A dragon?\" they’d laugh. \"Are you off your meds, Brody?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "One evening, as the sun dipped below the hills, painting the sky in fiery hues, Smokey let out a cry that shook the very foundations of the town. It wasn't a roar of anger, but one of longing, of recognition. Above them, high in the fading light, a shimmering portal, like spun starlight, began to open.\n",
            "\n",
            "Smokey unfolded its magnificent wings, scales catching the last rays of sunlight. It looked at the gathered townsfolk, its amber eyes seeming to linger on Timmy and Mrs. Gable. A small, almost imperceptible nod. Then, with a mighty beat of its wings, it soared upwards, a majestic silhouette against the swirling vortex.\n",
            "\n",
            "It paused at the edge of the portal, looking back one last time. Then, with a final, echoing sigh that carried a hint of gratitude, it slipped through, and the starry gate winked shut, leaving the sky once again serene.\n",
            "\n",
            "Willow Creek returned to its quiet rhythms, but it was never quite the same. Mrs. Gable's roses grew back stronger, strangely resilient. The old oak tree felt perpetually warm to the touch. And every now and then, when the wind was just right, a faint scent of ozone and burnt sugar would drift through the air, reminding them all of the time a lost dragon found a temporary home in their small, unsuspecting town.\n"
